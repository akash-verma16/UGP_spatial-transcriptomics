# UGP_spatial-transcriptomics
This is repository contains the work done during UGP under the supervision of Prof.Hamim Zafar. In our UGP project, we were tasked with the problem of creating a joint representation of xenium and visium data to solve two tasks: imputation and deconvolution.

## Repository Contents : 
imputation_code_and_results.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete workflow for the imputation task. It includes all the code for data preprocessing, model implementation, and training. The notebook is structured with the code at the beginning, followed by the "resulting plots and visualizations" at the end.

deconvolution_code_and_results.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete workflow for the deconvolution task. It includes the code for data handling, model execution, and analysis. Similar to the imputation file, the code is presented at the beginning, and the "resulting plots and figures" are shown at the end.

comparison_with_siid.pdf: This PDF document (originally a python notebook , can't be uploaded due to size issues) presents a comparative analysis of our model's performance against "siid". It contains **comparative plots between truth , our model and siid** .
